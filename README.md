# NXT Robot
An autonomous robot designed for ECSE-211 Design Principles and Methods.

The code uses extensive multi-threading to allow the robot to perform its tasks in parallel. These tasks include:
1. Localizing in its environment using ultrasonic and color sensors.
2. Navigating an obstacle-filled path between its starting location and destination.
3. Launching a series of ping-pong balls at a target from its destination.
4. Returning to its starting location.

In addition, the robot was given a Bluetooth interface to allow for data logging and remote control from a PC.
